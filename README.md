# Influenza-Season-Analysis
## Motivation:
The United States has an influenza season where more people than usual suffer from
the flu. Some people, particularly those in vulnerable populations, develop serious
complications and end up in the hospital. Hospitals and clinics need additional staff to
adequately treat these extra patients. The medical staffing agency provides this
temporary staff.
## Objective:
Determine when to send staff, and how many, to each state.
## Scope:
The agency covers all hospitals in each of the 50 states of the United States, and the
project will plan for the upcoming influenza season.
## Hypothesis:
If the vulnerable population (patient is older than 65 years old) increases, then the rate
of mortality increases.
